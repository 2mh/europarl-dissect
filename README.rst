europarl-dissect
================

``europarl-dissect'' is an experimental toolset to play around with
distributional semantics. 

It consists of two programs, one for preparing and preprocessing the
input data, the other one to calculate the similarity of input material to 
the semantic space established and show off the candidates.

- ``create_input_data.py'' processes (parallelized) training data available
- ``besttranslations.py'' shows candidates based on training data and input
